# GraphQL Sandbox
Personal project to play with graphQL related capabilities.

# Startup:
- Check package.json "engines" for supported node version
- `npm i`
- use `npm start` to run the app and `npm run express:local` to run the express/graphql server

## Other Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
